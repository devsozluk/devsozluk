### **About**

**DevSözlük**, is a platform created for software developers to ask, answer, share knowledge,
and communicate with each other. In this project, I have created a structure where other software developers can also contribute.
This platform allows software developers to share their ideas, answer questions, and help each other.

### **Technologies;**

* Redux
* TypeScript
